# Overview
It looks like there are two main sources of documentation. One source is the original one I used and there seems to be another source that is specific to North America. Looking over the documentation it seems like both source are talking about the same API so I am not sure what is different.
- Original source: https://docs.fiserv.dev/public/docs/introduction
- Regional source: https://developer.fiserv.com/product/IPGNA/docs/?path=/docs/additionalInfo/HostedPaymentPages.md&branch=main&gettingStarted=true

This guide is based on going over both but links will be prioritizing the regional notes
